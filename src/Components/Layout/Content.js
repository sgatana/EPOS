                  Sustainable peace in Kenya, will only be realized when we each discover that our
                  individual and collective actions constitute choices either for peace or
                  violence. The church, while not offering all the answers, holds thep
                  ossibility that we can begin to build biblical foundations for
                  peace and reconciliation. This programme trains church leaders
                  to acquire the essential knowledge and skills needed for reconciliation
                  and the mediation process. It aims at strengthening local capacities to
                  develop creative strategies for interventions within communities and
                  to work towards conflict prevention, resolution and peaceful co-existence.
